        Despite the devastation of WWII, and following decades of decay to the east of the infamous Berlin Wall, the city has been rebuilt in a way that celebrates its successes while acknowledging a dark past. Here is a list of the top tourist attractions in Berlin.

      <h2>1. The Brandenburg Gate</h2>

        <div class="body-item">
            <p>Berlin's most famous historic landmark is the Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor), once a symbol of a divided nation and now a symbol of unity and peace. This Neoclassical gate was commissioned by King Frederick Wilhelm II in 1788, and its design was inspired by the Propylaea in Athens' Acropolis. The sandstone monument is 26 meters tall, standing in the Mitte district's Pariser Platz, just a block from the Reichstag building. During the Cold War, its physical and symbolic position as a blocked gate along the Berlin Wall made it a frequent site for demonstrations by West Berliners, and it is famous for being the backdrop of US President Ronald Reagan's 1987 entreaty to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall.

<h2>2. The Rebuilt Reichstag</h2>
<div class="flex-item">

   
<div class="body-item">
   <p>The Reichstag (Reichstagsgebäude) was originally completed in 1894 where the Neo-Renaissance palace served as the home of the German Empire's Imperial Diet until it burned in 1933. It was not used again until after the reunification of Germany, at which point it underwent a 10-year reconstruction and finally became the home of the German Parliament in 1999. A highlight of this magnificent reconstruction is the replacement dome, the Kuppel, made of glass and offering superb views of the surrounding city, especially at night from the Rooftop Restaurant.

<div class="body-item">
   <p>Sandwiched between the River Spree and the Kupfergraben in a 400-meter-long canal, Spree Island is better known as Museum Island (Museumsinsel), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
    The first museum on the island was the Altes Museum (Old Museum).
     Opened in 1830, it was designed to give the general public access to collections of art and historically important objects and artefacts. 
     This nineteenth-century notion of a museum as a public institution celebrating great works of art had its roots in the Age of Enlightenment and its educational ideals. 
     Already known as the Museum Island by the late 1870s, the ensemble of other five museums was finally completed in 1930.

<h2>4. Berlin Wall Memorial</h2>
<div class="flex-item">
    

<div class="body-item">
   <p>The Berlin Wall originated in 1961 when East Germany sealed off that half of the city to prevent citizens from fleeing to West Germany. By the time it was torn down in 1989, the four-meter-high wall extended 155 kilometers, dissected 55 streets, and possessed 293 observation towers and 57 bunkers. Today, only small stretches of this graffiti-covered travesty remain, including a 1.4-kilometer stretch preserved as part of the Berlin Wall Memorial (Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer), a chilling reminder of the animosity that once divided Europe.

<div class="body-item">
   <p>Despite celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2020, the 368-meter-tall Berliner Fernsehturm (Berlin Television Tower) has lost none of its appeal to visitors to the city. Originally constructed to mark the prowess of communism (it's located in the former East Berlin district), the landmark can be picked out from pretty much every corner of the city, making it more significant as a symbol of the city's reunification in the 1980s.

   <p>Also of interest is Checkpoint Charlie Museum (Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie). Marking the best-known crossing point between East and West Berlin, this fascinating tourist attraction features numerous displays and artifacts tracing the history of human rights, along with exhibits dealing specifically with the history of the Berlin Wall, and Checkpoint Charlie. Situated next to the original guardhouse, the museum also highlights some of the most interesting attempts made by those trying to escape communist rule, including an original homemade air balloon used in one successful attempt.</p>

   <p>The Gendarmenmarkt, one of Berlin's largest squares, is dominated by three historic landmark buildings: the Konzerthaus, the French Cathedral (Französischer Dom), and the German Cathedral (Deutscher Dom). This picturesque 17th-century square is now one of Berlin's top tourist attractions, hosting numerous public events each year, including classical concerts on the steps of the Konzerthaus theater in the summer, while each December the entire plaza becomes the city's famous Christmas Market.

<h2>8. German Museum of Technology</h2>

<div class="body-item">
   <p>The must-see German Museum of Technology (Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin) was established in 1983 to showcase and celebrate Germany's industrial and technological prowess. There are plenty of fun things to see in this popular museum, including taking in displays related to the Industrial Revolution, getting some hands-on experience in a reconstructed workshop, as well as a fascinating look at the vehicles that evolved alongside this rise in mechanization. There are plenty of vehicles and aircraft on display, including a number of preserved steam engines dating back as far as 1843. Other highlights include riding in a vintage 1930s train from the museum to its locomotive depot on the weekends.
